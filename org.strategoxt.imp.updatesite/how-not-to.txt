Ways to Shoot Yourself in the Foot When Creating an Eclipse Update Site

1.  DON'T strictly follow these steps; failure to do so at any point will result in various forms of fun unexplained or misleading failures at deployment time
2.  DON'T update the versions of all involved plugins and the org.strategoxt.imp.feature project
3.  DON'T open feature.xml in Eclipse and all versions to those in the projects using the "Versions" button
4.  DON'T open site.xml in Eclipse and choose "Add Feature" and add the new feature (be sure you DON'T put it in the category so it won't show up)
5.  Or DON'T pick "Synchronize all" if you made an update site already
6.  There is no number 6.
7.  DON'T choose "Build All"; if you pick "Build" it will act like its building but won't build all plugins
8.  Especially DON'T invoke your favorite deity through prayer and/or song at this point
9.  When you upload the update site, be sure you DON'T skip artifacts.xml and content.xml so Eclipse will magically fail when updating
10. If you're using a testing directory for updates, be sure you DON'T adapt site.xml with the new url
11. Finally, to test it, DON'T use a clean Eclipse installation and DON'T use a clean workspace (Eclipse 3.4+ may do workspace-based caching!)
